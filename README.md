# Vortex-Panel-Method-for-Airfoil-Aerodynamic-Coefficients
This repository makes use of the Vortex Panel Method to calculate the Lift, Drag and Pressure Coefficients of any airfoil at a specified Freestream Velocity, Chord Length and Angle of Attack by providing the X and Y coordinates of the airfoil in a .dat file.
